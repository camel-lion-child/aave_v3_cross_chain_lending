This folder is intentionally empty in GitHub.

Instead of storing CSV or Parquet inside the repository, I add a small placeholder file named `.gitkeep` in each folder. This technique is common in data engineering projects and allows the folder structure to be tracked by Git without storing actual datasets.

Purpose of `.gitkeep`:

- Ensure the `data/raw/` and `data/processed/` folders appear in the repo
- Keep the repository structure clear and reproducible
- Avoid committing large or mutable datasets
- Inform users where the pipeline will write raw and processed files locally.
